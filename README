Hi All,
  Here is a script I use quite often when coding
and I want to temporarily comment out a chunk
of C/C++ source code.

Usage:
Select the block of code you want to comment out
(in visual mode) and invoke :call PComment().

This inputs
#if 0
<code block>
#endif

You can also invoke it without the visual selection
and it comments the current line.

It will also remove an #if 0 block as follows:

#if 0
<code block>
#endif

using the above example, place the cursor anywhere
on the #if 0 line and invoke the function, voila 
code block is restored and the #if 0 and #endif are gone.

Heres a more advance example, suppose you have the
following:

#if 0
<code block>
#else
<code block>
#endif

if you invoke the command on the #if 0 the #else
it will automatically be converted to #if 0 and the code 
block above will be restored, like so:

<code block>
#if 0
<code block>
#endif

Also works with nested #if 0 #endif blocks:

Suppose you have a large chunk of code that already
has some #if 0 blocks.  No problem, select all you want
including the nested comment blocks and invoke the function,
when you want to remove the comment the proper #endif
is matched and removed.

Example:

<code block1>
#if 0
<code block2>
#endif
<code block3>
<code block4>

Select all up to code block3 and invoke the function,
we get:

#if 0
<code block1>
#if 0
<code block2>
#endif
<code block3>
#endif
<code block4>

Move to the first #if 0 and invoke the function, voila
you should be back to square one again.

Hope you all like it.
Have fun.
